# Company-Performance-Dashboard-using-Power-BI
## Project Overview

This project is a company performance reporting dashboard developed in Power BI for a plant supply company that delivers plants to various companies across multiple countries. The dashboard tracks and analyses key business metrics such as sales, quantity, and gross profit, enabling comparisons of current year performance versus the previous year and detailed drill-downs by country, product, and client.

## Key Features

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Used Power Query to clean and standardise raw sales and supply data.

Data Modelling: Connected multiple tables to create a unified data model for accurate analysis.

Date & Slicer Tables: Created a Dim_Date table and a slicer table (Sales, Quantity, Gross Profit) for interactive reporting.

DAX Measures: Calculated YTD (Year-to-Date) and PYTD (Previous Year-to-Date) metrics for sales, quantity, and gross profit and implemented switch measures linked to slicers for dynamic visuals.

Visual Analytics: Interactive charts comparing YTD vs PYTD metrics, with drill-downs by Country → Product → Client to monitors KPIs like Gross Profit % vs Sales for all clients.
